## How can I use it?
Simple open a chat with [@what_is_dog_bot](http://telegram.me/what_is_dog_bot) and send your favourite pooch pics.

## How it's made
I trained a neural network using TensorFlow to classify images dogs by breed. This network was trained over the course of 6 hours using over 21,000 images.
